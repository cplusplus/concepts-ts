<!-- Code Block
  Code block elements are used to wrap program fragments in C++.

  For improved source clarity, this element removes leading and trailing
  whitespace from its contents.

  This element also prevents the HTML parser from ending a surrounding <p> tag
  when it sees the opening <pre>.

  TODO: This could call into a syntax highlighter that styles
  comments correctly.
