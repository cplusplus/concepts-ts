<!-- Code Block
  Code block elements are used to wrap program fragments in C++. The
  element is partially formatted for improved rendering by removing
  leading and trailing whitespace that is generally annoying in
  <pre> blocks.

  Also, without this, <pre> block was being rendered outside of examples.
  That's not desirable.

  TODO: If somebody was clever, this could shell out to a code highlighter
  and actually return C++ code wrapped with html tags for formatting
  things like comments, etc. I wonder if that could be extended to 
  auto-escape the text so we could just write examples plainly.

  TODO: The codeblock should take a link argument so we can import
  codeblocks directly from C++ files. That would make it possible for
  an implementer to create a test suite on top of examples written
  in the standard.
