<!-- This element creates a button that creates a standalone HTML version of
     the current page in a new window so you can save it.
     This will only work with the ShadowDOM polyfill, since you can't create
     ShadowDOM without script.

     If the 'source' attribute is present, a "Sources at ..." comment
     will appear at the top of the result document.
