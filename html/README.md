Overview
========

This document uses the HTML/CSS infrastructure found at
[https://github.com/cplusplus/html-doc-framework](https://github.com/cplusplus/html-doc-framework).

Follow those instructions to get the most recent version of that
presentation framework. This document may use elements and styles
not found in the main distribution. A fork of that repository at
[https://github.com/asutton/html-doc-framework](https://github.com/asutton/html-doc-framework).

I believe that you can install this version using bower, by running
this command instead of the one found on the previous page's 
instructions.

    bower install asutton/html-doc-framework
