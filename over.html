  <h1>Overloading</h1>

  Modify paragraph 1 to allow overloading based on constraints.

  <p class="quoted">
  When two or more different declarations are specified for a single name 
  in the same scope, that name is said to be overloaded. By extension, two 
  declarations in the same scope that declare the same name but with
  different types 
  <ins>or different associated constraints (<cxx-ref to="temp"></cxx-ref>)</ins>
  are called <dfn>overloaded declarations</dfn>. Only function and function 
  template declarations can be overloaded; variable and type declarations 
  cannot be overloaded.
  </p>

  Update paragraph 3 to mention a function's overloaded constraints. 
  Note that the itemized list in the original text is omitted in this
  document.

  <p number="3" class="quoted">
  <cxx-note>
  As specified in <cxx-ref to="dcl.fct"></cxx-ref>, function declarations 
  that have equivalent parameter declarations

  declare the same function and therefore cannot be overloaded: ...

  <cxx-section id="over.dcl" number="2">
    <h1>Declaration matching</h1>

    Modify paragraph 1 to extend the notion of declaration matching to
    also include a function's associated constrains. Note that the
    example in the original text is omitted in this document.

    <p class="quoted">
    Two function declarations of the same name refer to the same function if 
    they are in the same scope and have equivalent parameter declarations 
    (<cxx-ref in="cxx" to="over.load"></cxx-ref>)

  <cxx-section id="over.match">
    <h1>Overload resolution</h1>

    <cxx-section id="over.match.viable">
      <h1>Viable functions</h1>

      Update paragraph 1 to require the checking of a candidate's associated
      constraints when determining if that candidate is viable.

      <p class="quoted">
      From the set of candidate functions constructed for a given context 
      (<cxx-ref in="cxx" to="over.match.funcs"></cxx-ref>), a set of viable 
      functions is chosen, from which the best function will be selected by 
      comparing argument conversion sequences and associated constraints
      for the best fit (<cxx-ref to="over.match.best"></cxx-ref>).

      The selection of viable functions considers 
      <ins>their associated constraints, if any (<cxx-ref to="temp"></cxx-ref>), and</ins>
      their relationships between arguments and function parameters other 
      than the ranking of conversion sequences.
      </p>

      Insert the following paragraph after paragraph 1; this introduces
      new a criterion for determining if a candidate is viable. Also, update
      the beginning of the subsequent paragraphs to account for the
      insertion.

      <p class="quoted" number="2">
      First, for <code>F</code> to be a viable function, if <code>F</code> has 
      associated constraints (<cxx-ref to="temp"></cxx-ref>), those 
      constraints shall be satisfied (<cxx-ref to="temp.constr"></cxx-ref>).

      <p class="quoted" number="3">

    <cxx-section id="over.match.best">
      <h1>Best viable function</h1>

      Modify the last item in the list in paragraph 1 and extend it with
      a final comparison based on the associated constraints of those
      functions. Note that the preceding (unmodified) items in the original 
      document are elided in this document.

      <p class="quoted">
      Define ICS<i>i</i>(<code>F</code>) as follows:
      <ul>

  <cxx-section id="over.over">
    <h1>Address of overloaded function</h1>

    The introduction of constraints modifies the rules for determining
    which function is selected when taking the address of an overloaded
    function. Insert a new paragraph before paragraph 4.

    <p class="quoted" number="4">
    If a single constrained function is selected, and the constraints are
    not satisfied (<cxx-ref to="temp.constr"></cxx-ref>), the program
    is ill-formed. 
    </p>

    Modify paragraph 4 (paragraph 5 in this document) to incorporate 
    constraints in the selection of an overloaded function when its address is 
    taken. Also add the following example after that in the original document 
    (not shown here).

    <p number="5" class="quoted">
    If more than one function is selected, any function template 
    specializations in the set are eliminated if the set also contains a 
    function that is not a function template 
    specialization<del>, and</del><ins>. 

    Any given non-template function
    <code>F0</code> is eliminated if the set contains a second non-template
    function that is more constrained than <code>F0</code> according to
    the partial ordering rules of 
    <cxx-ref to="temp.constr.order"></cxx-ref>.</ins>
    
    <ins>Furthermore,</ins> any given function template specialization
    <code>F1</code> is eliminated if the set contains a second function 
    template specialization whose function template is more specialized than 
    the function template of <code>F1</code> according to the partial ordering 
    rules of <cxx-ref to="temp.func.order"></cxx-ref>.

    After such eliminations, if any, there shall remain exactly one 
    selected function.

    <cxx-example>
    <cxx-codeblock>
void f() { }                // <i>#1</i>
void f() requires true { }; // <i>#2</i>
void g() requires false;

void (*pf)() = &amp;f;         // <i>selects #2</i>
void (*pg)() = &amp;g;         // <i>error: g() cannot be selected</i>
