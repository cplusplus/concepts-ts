<p>
The word "constant" only appears once in normative text in N4377. It is unclear
to me whether a predicate constraint that is not a constant-expression is 
ill- formed (which would require a diagnostic for a non-temploid function with a
requires-clause whose expression is not constant), or merely not satisfied.
</p>

<p>
It is useful to note that the "ill-formed" position leads to further issues
where constant-expressions of the form <code>P || Q</code> may be written such that
normalization of constraints will form <i>P or Q</i> where <i>Q</i> is a predicate constraint
whose expression is not a constant-expression.
</p>

<p>
Faisal Vali, Andrew Sutton, and Gabriel Dos Reis agree that
predicate constraints containing non-constant expressions should
be ill-formed.
</p>

<p>
Andrew Sutton suggests: If Q is not dependent and not a constant expression, 
then the program would be ill-formed. Otherwise if, as a result of substituting 
during satisfaction, Q is not a constant expression the program is
ill-formed.
</p>

<p>
However, if Q is dependent but never evaluated (because P is
satisfied), the program is well-formed. This would be the same if
substitution into Q would result in substitution failures (e.g., if Q
is <code>X&lt;T&gt;::value</code>).
