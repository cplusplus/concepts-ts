<title>Implicit bool for concepts</title>

<p>
Since a concept's type always must be <code>bool</code>, there seems little reason to
require the source code to say  so explicitly. Typing concept should be
sufficient without also typing bool immediately afterward.

Allow the compiler to supply bool (a) as the implicit return type for a
function concept and (b) as the implicit type for a variable concept. (Note:
this comment is implicitly accepted if issue <iref ref="7"/> is accepted.)

<p>
Also see issues <iref ref="6"/> and <iref ref="7"/> as they relate.
</p>

<p>
EWG is generally in favor of resolving this and related issues, but there
is no consensus on how to procdeed.
