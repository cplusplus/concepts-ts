<title>Simplify concept definitions</title>

<p>
Using <code>concept</code> as a <i>decl-specifer</i>, rather than forming a first class
entity like a type or template, makes the feature appear more complex than
it needs to be. Concepts would be simpler (for user and [we believe]
the specification) if there was only one kind, rather than both function
and variable syntax; the <code>bool</code> keyword would become redundant and the
set of restrictions on concepts based on them being functions or variables
would disappear.

We will provide a paper in time for the Lenexa pre meeting mailing
proposing a grammar that would give all concepts the form:

<pre>
<code>
    template &lt;typename T&gt;
    concept C = predicate;
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Also see issues <iref ref="7"/> and <iref ref="8"/> as they relate.
</p>

<p>
EWG is generally in favor of resolving this and related issues, but there
is no consensus on how to procdeed.
