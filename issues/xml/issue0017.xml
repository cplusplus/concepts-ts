The wording in N4377 subclause 14.10.3 [temp.constr.order] bullet 2.2 reads:
<ul>
<li>a disjunctive clause Pi subsumes a conjunctive clause Qj if and only if each atomic constraint in Pi subsumes any atomic constraint Qj, where</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
Firstly, as a conjunctive clause of a constraint in CNF, Qj may be a disjunction
as opposed to an atomic constraint. Adding "in" to give "any atomic constraint
in Qj" might be an editorial fix, but it does not fix the issue below.
</p>

<p>
Given "A and B" as P0, and "A" as Q0; then my reading of the "each subsumes any"
wording is that P0 subsumes Q0 if and only if each atomic constraint in P0 (that
is, A and B) subsumes A. That is: (A subsumes A) <i>and</i> (B subsumes A).
</p>

<p>
I believe the intent is that Pi subsumes Qj if and only if there exists an
atomic constraint, Pia, in Pi for which there exists an atomic constraint, Qjb,
in Qj such that Pia subsumes Qjb. I am not seeing a way to reconcile the current
wording of bullet 2.2 with what I believe the intent is.
