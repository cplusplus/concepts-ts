<title>Concerns about subsumption and equivalence rules</title>

<p>
We have a broad concern that it is hard to understand the feature purely
from the specification, especially the subsumption rules, and equivalence
rules to know when two signatures declare the same function or
are ambiguous equally constrained overloads, yet there is a lack of readily
available implementations to test our understanding against. While the feature
set of the TS looks good, we think one more iteration on the specification
would be useful.

Proposed solution: Recast the rules for subsumption as a mini grammar
(distinct from the C++ grammar) as the English text appears to be trying to
describe a grammar, but less formally, which leads to a potential lack of
precision, and more confusion for the reader. We are not highlighting specific
lack of precision at this time, as we have not emerged from confusion in
time to file appropriate comments.

EWG believes this is strictly a wording issue. Returned to CWG.
