<h1>C++ Concepts Active Issues List (Revision 2)</h1>
<p>Revised 2016-02-27 at 18:02:31 UTC</p>

  <p>Reference ISO/IEC TS 19217</p>

  <p>This document contains the C++ core language issues for the Concepts
  Technical specification which the Committee (INCITS PL22.16 + WG21) has not
  yet acted, that is, issues with status
  <a href="ts-active.html#Ready">Ready</a>,
  <a href="ts-active.html#TentativelyReady">Tentatively Ready</a>,
  <a href="ts-active.html#Review">Review</a>,
  <a href="ts-active.html#Drafting">Drafing</a>,
  <a href="ts-active.html#Open">Open</a>, and
  <a href="ts-active.html#New">New</a>.
  (See <a href="#Status">Issue Status</a> below).


  <p>This document is part of a group of related documents that together
  describe the issues that have been raised regarding the C++ Standard.
  The other documents in the group are:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><a href="ts-toc.html">Table of Contents</a> for all concepts issues.</li>
      <li><a href="ts-index.html">Index by Section</a> for all concepts issues.</li>

      <li><a href="ts-closed.html">Closed Issues List</a></li>
      <li><a href="ts-defect.html">Defect Reports List</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Section references in this document refelct the section numbering
  in document <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4549.pdf">
  WG21 N4549</a>.</p>

  <p>The purpose of these documents is to record the disposition of issues
  that have come before the Core Language Working Group of the ANSI
  (INCITS PL22.16) and ISO (WG21) C++ Standard Committee.</p>

  <p>The issues in these lists are not necessarily formal ISO Defect
  Reports (DR's). While some issues will eventually be elevated to
  official Defect Report status, other issues will be disposed of in
  other ways.</p>

<h2><a name="Status"></a>Issue Status</h2>


  <p>Issues progress through various statuses as the Core Language Working Group
  and, ultimately, the full PL22.16 and WG21 committees deliberate and act. For
  ease of reference, issues are grouped in these documents by their status.
  Issues have one of the following statuses:</p>

  <p><b>Open</b>: The issue is new or the working group has not yet formed an
  opinion on the issue. If a Suggested Resolution is given, it reflects the
  opinion of the issue's submitter, not necessarily that of the working group
  or the Committee as a whole.</p>

  <p><b>Drafting</b>: Informal consensus has been reached in the working group
  and is described in rough terms in a Tentative Resolution, although precise
  wording for the change is not yet available.</p>

  <p><b>Review</b>: Exact wording of a Proposed Resolution is now available for
  an issue on which the working group previously reached informal consensus.</p>

  <p><b>Ready</b>: The working group has reached consensus that a change in the
  working draft is required, the Proposed Resolution is correct, and the issue
  is ready to forward to the full Committee for ratification.

  <p><b>Tentatively Ready</b>: Like "ready" except that the resolution was
  produced and approved by a subset of the working group membership between
  meetings. Persons not participating in these between-meeting activities are
  encouraged to review such resolutions carefully and to alert the working
  group with any problems that may be found.</p>

  <p><b>DR</b>: The full Committee has approved the item as a proposed defect
  report. The Proposed Resolution in an issue with this status reflects the
  best judgment of the Committee at this time regarding the action that will
  be taken to remedy the defect; however, the current wording of the Standard
  remains in effect until such time as a Technical Corrigendum or a revision
  of the Standard is issued by ISO.</p>

  <p><b>Dup</b>: The issue is identical to or a subset of another issue,
  identified in a Rationale statement.

  <p><b>NAD</b>: The working group has reached consensus that the issue is
  not a defect in the Standard. A Rationale statement describes the working
  group's reasoning.

  <p><b>Extension</b>: The working group has reached consensus that the issue
  is not a defect in the Standard but is a request for an extension to the
  language. The working group expresses no opinion on the merits of an issue
  with this status; however, the issue will be maintained on the list for
  possible future consideration as an extension proposal.
