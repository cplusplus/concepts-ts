The Technical Specification concepts is found in the `src` directory
and is written in LatEx. There is a Makefile that can be used to compile
the sources.

An earlier version of the specification can be found in the HTML directory;
it was written in HTML using a Javascript/CSS framework for formatting.
This is *not* the current version of the document.
