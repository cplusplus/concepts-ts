    <h1>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>C++ has long provided language support for generic programming in 
    the form of templates. 
    
    However, these templates are unconstrained, allowing any type or value 
    to be substituted for a template argument, often resulting in compiler 
    errors. 
    
    What is lacking is a specification of an interface for a template, 
    separate from its implementation, so that a use of a template can be 
    selected among alternative templates and checked in isolation.</p>

    <p>A concept is a predicate that defines the syntactic and semantic 
    requirements on template arguments. 
    A template argument that satisfies these requirements is said to be a 
    <emph>model</emph> of that concept, or that the argument 
    <emph>models</emph> the concept.
    
    Syntactic requirements specify the set of valid expressions that can 
    be used with conforming types and the types associated with those 
    expressions. 
    
    Semantic requirements describe the required behavior of those syntactic 
    requirements and also provide complexity guarantees. 
    
    Concepts are the basis of generic programming in C++ and support the 
    ability to reason about generic algorithms and data structures 
    independently of their instantiation by concrete template arguments.</p>

    <p>Concepts are not new to C++ or even to C (where Integral and 
    Arithmetic are long-established concepts used to specify the language 
    rules for types); the idea of stating and enforcing type requirements 
    on template arguments has a long history. For example, several methods are 
    discussed in <emph>The Design and Evolution of C++</emph> (1994). 
    Concepts were a part of documentation of the STL and are used to 
    express requirements in the C++ standard, ISO/IEC 14882. 
    For example, Table 106 gives the definition of the STL 
    <code>Iterator</code> concept as a list of valid expressions and their 
    result types, operational semantics, and pre- and  post-conditions.</p>

    <p>This specification describes a solution to the problem of 
    constraining template arguments in the form "Concepts Lite." The 
    goals of "Concepts Lite" are to
    <ul>
      <li>allow programmers to directly state the requirements of a set of 
      template arguments as part of a template's interface,</li>

      <li>support function overloading and class template specialization 
        based on constraints,</li>

      <li>seamlessly integrates a number of orthogonal features to provide
      uniform syntax and semantics for generic lambdas, <code>auto</code>
      declarations, and result type deduction,</li>

      <li>fundamentally improves diagnostics by checking template arguments 
      in terms of stated intent at the point of use,</li>

      <li>do all of this without any runtime overhead or longer compilation 
      times, when comparing similar programs using 
      <code>enable_if</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    "Concepts Lite" does not provide facilities for checking template 
    definitions separately from their instantiation, nor does it provide 
    facilities for specifying or checking semantic requirements.</p>


    <p>This Technical Specification specifies requirements for 
    implementations of an extension to the C++ programming language 
    concerning the application of constraints to template arguments, 
    the use of constraints in function overloading and class template 
    specialization, and the definition of those constraints.</p>

    <p>International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context
    and specification for this Technical Specification. This document as 
    written as a set of changes against that specification. Notes in 
    this Technical Specification indicate how and where new text should 
    be added to or removed from the International Standard. 
    <cxx-note>The proposal is written against the C++14 specification,
    whatever its final document number may be.</cxx-note></p>

    <p>The design of this specification is based, in part, on a concept 
    specification of the algorithms part of the C++ standard library, known 
    as ``The Palo Alto" TR (WG21 N3351), which was developed by a large 
    group of experts as a test of the expressive power of the idea of 
    concepts. Despite syntactic differences between the notation of the 
    Palo Alto TR and this TS, the TR can be seen as a large-scale test of 
    the expressiveness of this TS.</p>
