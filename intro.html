    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>This technical specification describes extensions to the C++ 
    Programming language (<cxx-ref to="intro.refs"></cxx-ref>) that
    enable the specification and checking of constraints on template 
    arguments, and the ability to overload functions and specialize
    templates based on those constraints. These extensions include 
    new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language semantics.</p>

    <p>International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context
    and specification for this Technical Specification. This document as 
    written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions
    to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. 
    Modifications made directly to existing text from the International
    Standard use <ins>underlining</ins> to represent added text and
    <del>strikethrough</del> to represent deleted text.</p>

    <p>Conformance requirements for this specification are the same as those

    <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
  
    <p>The design of this specification is based, in part, on a concept 
    specification of the algorithms part of the C++ standard library, known 
    as ``The Palo Alto" TR (WG21 N3351), which was developed by a large 
    group of experts as a test of the expressive power of the idea of 
    concepts. Despite syntactic differences between the notation of the 
    Palo Alto TR and this TS, the TR can be seen as a large-scale test of 
    the expressiveness of this TS.</p>
